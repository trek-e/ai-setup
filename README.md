# Caliber

**Hand-written `CLAUDE.md` files go stale the moment you refactor.** Your AI agent hallucinates paths that no longer exist, misses new dependencies, and gives advice based on yesterday's architecture. Caliber generates and maintains your AI context files (`CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/`, `AGENTS.md`, `copilot-instructions.md`) so they stay accurate as your code evolves — and keeps every agent on your team in sync, whether they use Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, or GitHub Copilot.

## Before / After

Most repos start with a hand-written `CLAUDE.md` and nothing else. Here's what Caliber finds — and fixes:

```
  Before                                    After /setup-caliber
  ──────────────────────────────            ──────────────────────────────

```

Scoring is deterministic — no LLM, no API calls. It cross-references your config files against your actual project filesystem: do referenced paths exist? Are code blocks present? Is there config drift since your last commit?

```bash
caliber score --compare main    # See how your branch changed the score
```

## Get Started

Requires **Node.js >= 20**.

```bash
npx @rely-ai/caliber bootstrap
```

Then, in your terminal (not the IDE chat), start a Claude Code or Cursor CLI session and type:

> **/setup-caliber**

Your agent detects your stack, generates tailored configs for every platform your team uses, sets up pre-commit hooks, and enables continuous sync — all from inside your normal workflow.

**Don't use Claude Code or Cursor?** Run `caliber init` instead — it's the same setup as a CLI wizard. Works with any LLM provider: bring your own Anthropic, OpenAI, or Vertex AI key.

> **Your code stays on your machine.** Bootstrap is 100% local — no LLM calls, no code sent anywhere. Generation uses your own AI subscription or API key. Caliber never sees your code.

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows Users</strong></summary>

Caliber works on Windows with a few notes:

- **Run from your terminal** (PowerShell, CMD, or Git Bash) — not from inside an IDE chat window. Open a terminal, `cd` into your project folder, then run `npx @rely-ai/caliber bootstrap`.
- **Git Bash is recommended.** Caliber's pre-commit hooks and auto-sync scripts use shell syntax. Git for Windows includes Git Bash, which handles this automatically. If you only use PowerShell, hooks may be skipped silently.
- **Cursor Agent CLI:** If prompted to install it, download from [cursor.com/downloads](https://www.cursor.com/downloads) instead of the `curl | bash` command shown on macOS/Linux. Then run `agent login` in your terminal to authenticate.
- **One terminal at a time.** Avoid running Caliber from multiple terminals simultaneously — this can cause conflicting state and unexpected provider detection.

</details>

## Audits first, writes second

Caliber never overwrites your existing configs without asking. The workflow mirrors code review:

1. **Score** — read-only audit of your current setup
2. **Propose** — generate or improve configs, shown as a diff
3. **Review** — accept, refine via chat, or decline each change
4. **Backup** — originals saved to `.caliber/backups/` before every write
5. **Undo** — `caliber undo` restores everything to its previous state

If your existing config scores **95+**, Caliber skips full regeneration and applies targeted fixes to the specific checks that are failing.

## How It Works

Bootstrap gives your agent the `/setup-caliber` skill. Your agent analyzes your project — languages, frameworks, dependencies, architecture — generates configs, and installs hooks. From there, it's a loop:

```
  npx @rely-ai/caliber bootstrap       ← one-time, 2 seconds
              │
              ▼
  agent runs /setup-caliber             ← agent handles everything
              │
              ▼
  ┌──── configs generated ◄────────────┐
  │           │                        │
  │           ▼                        │
  │     your code evolves              │
  │     (new deps, renamed files,      │
  │      changed architecture)         │
  │           │                        │
  │           ▼                        │
  └──► caliber refresh ──────────────►─┘
       (auto, on every commit)
```

Pre-commit hooks run the refresh loop automatically. New team members get nudged to bootstrap on their first session.

### What It Generates

**Claude Code**
- `CLAUDE.md` — Project context, build/test commands, architecture, conventions
- `CALIBER_LEARNINGS.md` — Patterns learned from your AI coding sessions
- `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` — Reusable skills ([OpenSkills](https://agentskills.io) format)
- `.mcp.json` — Auto-discovered MCP server configurations
- `.claude/settings.json` — Permissions and hooks

**Cursor**
- `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` — Modern rules with frontmatter (description, globs, alwaysApply)
- `.cursor/skills/*/SKILL.md` — Skills for Cursor
- `.cursor/mcp.json` — MCP server configurations

**OpenAI Codex**
- `AGENTS.md` — Project context for Codex
- `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` — Skills for Codex

**OpenCode**
- `AGENTS.md` — Project context (shared with Codex when both are targeted)
- `.opencode/skills/*/SKILL.md` — Skills for OpenCode

**GitHub Copilot**
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — Project context for Copilot

## Key Features

<details>
<summary><strong>Any Codebase</strong></summary>

TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby, Terraform, and more. Language and framework detection is fully LLM-driven — no hardcoded mappings. Caliber works on any project.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Any AI Tool</strong></summary>

`caliber bootstrap` auto-detects which agents you have installed. For manual control:
```bash
caliber init --agent claude        # Claude Code only
caliber init --agent cursor        # Cursor only
caliber init --agent codex         # Codex only
caliber init --agent opencode        # OpenCode only
caliber init --agent github-copilot  # GitHub Copilot only
caliber init --agent all             # All platforms
caliber init --agent claude,cursor   # Comma-separated
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Chat-Based Refinement</strong></summary>

Not happy with the generated output? During review, refine via natural language — describe what you want changed and Caliber iterates until you're satisfied.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>MCP Server Discovery</strong></summary>

Caliber detects the tools your project uses (databases, APIs, services) and auto-configures matching MCP servers for Claude Code and Cursor.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Deterministic Scoring</strong></summary>

`caliber score` evaluates your config quality without any LLM calls — purely by cross-referencing config files against your actual project filesystem.

| Category | Points | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| **Files & Setup** | 25 | Config files exist, skills present, MCP servers, cross-platform parity |
| **Quality** | 25 | Code blocks, concise token budget, concrete instructions, structured headings |
| **Grounding** | 20 | Config references actual project directories and files |
| **Accuracy** | 15 | Referenced paths exist on disk, config freshness vs. git history |
| **Freshness & Safety** | 10 | Recently updated, no leaked secrets, permissions configured |
| **Bonus** | 5 | Auto-refresh hooks, AGENTS.md, OpenSkills format |

Every failing check includes structured fix data — when `caliber init` runs, the LLM receives exactly what's wrong and how to fix it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Session Learning</strong></summary>

Caliber watches your AI coding sessions and learns from them. Hooks capture tool usage, failures, and your corrections — then an LLM distills operational patterns into `CALIBER_LEARNINGS.md`.

```bash
caliber learn install      # Install hooks for Claude Code and Cursor
caliber learn status       # View hook status, event count, and ROI summary
caliber learn finalize     # Manually trigger analysis (auto-runs on session end)
caliber learn remove       # Remove hooks
```

Learned items are categorized by type — **[correction]**, **[gotcha]**, **[fix]**, **[pattern]**, **[env]**, **[convention]** — and automatically deduplicated.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Auto-Refresh</strong></summary>

Keep configs in sync with your codebase automatically:

| Hook | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Git pre-commit** | Before each commit | Refreshes docs and stages updated files |
| **Claude Code session end** | End of each session | Runs `caliber refresh` and updates docs |
| **Learning hooks** | During each session | Captures events for session learning |

```bash
caliber hooks --install    # Enable refresh hooks
caliber hooks --remove     # Disable refresh hooks
```

The `refresh` command analyzes your git diff (committed, staged, and unstaged changes) and updates config files to reflect what changed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Team Onboarding</strong></summary>

When Caliber is set up in a repo, it automatically nudges new team members to configure it on their machine. A lightweight session hook checks whether the pre-commit hook is installed and prompts setup if not — no manual coordination needed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Fully Reversible</strong></summary>

- **Automatic backups** — originals saved to `.caliber/backups/` before every write
- **Score regression guard** — if a regeneration produces a lower score, changes are auto-reverted
- **Full undo** — `caliber undo` restores everything to its previous state
- **Clean uninstall** — `caliber uninstall` removes everything Caliber added (hooks, generated sections, skills, learnings) while preserving your own content
- **Dry run** — preview changes with `--dry-run` before applying

</details>

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it overwrite my existing configs?</strong></summary>

No. Caliber shows you a diff of every proposed change. You accept, refine, or decline each one. Originals are backed up automatically.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it need an API key?</strong></summary>

**Bootstrap & scoring:** No. Both run 100% locally with no LLM.

**Generation** (via `/setup-caliber` or `caliber init`): Uses your existing Claude Code or Cursor subscription (no API key needed), or bring your own key for Anthropic, OpenAI, or Vertex AI.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the difference between bootstrap and init?</strong></summary>

`caliber bootstrap` installs agent skills in 2 seconds — your agent then runs `/setup-caliber` to handle the rest from inside your session. `caliber init` is the full interactive wizard for users who prefer a CLI-driven setup. Both end up in the same place.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I don't like what it generates?</strong></summary>

Refine it via chat during review, or decline the changes entirely. If you already accepted, `caliber undo` restores everything. You can also preview with `--dry-run`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it work with monorepos?</strong></summary>

Yes. Run `caliber init` from any directory. `caliber refresh` can update configs across multiple repos when run from a parent directory.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it send my code anywhere?</strong></summary>

Scoring is fully local. Generation sends a project summary (languages, structure, dependencies — not source code) to whatever LLM provider you configure — the same provider your AI editor already uses. Anonymous usage analytics (no code, no file contents) can be disabled via `caliber config`.

</details>

## LLM Providers

No API key? No problem. Caliber works with your existing AI tool subscription:

| Provider | Setup | Default Model |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** (your seat) | `caliber config` → Claude Code | Inherited from Claude Code |
| **Cursor** (your seat) | `caliber config` → Cursor | Inherited from Cursor |
| **Anthropic** | `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| **OpenAI** | `export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` | `gpt-5.4-mini` |
| **Vertex AI** | `export VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=my-project` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| **Custom endpoint** | `OPENAI_API_KEY` + `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | `gpt-5.4-mini` |

Override the model for any provider: `export CALIBER_MODEL=<model-name>` or use `caliber config`.

Caliber uses a **two-tier model system** — lightweight tasks (classification, scoring) auto-use a faster model, while heavy tasks (generation, refinement) use the default. This keeps costs low and speed high.

Configuration is stored in `~/.caliber/config.json` with restricted permissions (`0600`). API keys are never written to project files.
